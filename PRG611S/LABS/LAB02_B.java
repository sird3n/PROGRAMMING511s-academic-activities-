//QUESTION
/*
Control Structures: As a build-up from the previous question, consider 3 possible scenarios of input: A character, number, or word. Your program should then do the following:
In case the input is a character it should indicate if it’s a vowel or not
when a number is entered then it’s should check if it’s a prime
Finally, if a word is entered the system should check if it’s a palindrome or not.

Sample Run 1                                                           Sample Run 3
Enter a character, number or word : c                                  Enter a character, number or word : 7
Output 1 : C is not a vowel                                            Output 3 : 7 is a prime number

Sample Run 2
Enter a character, number or word:  programming
Output 2: Programming is not a palindrome
